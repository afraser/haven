  <h4>Nick Mosher</h4>
  <p>Nick Mosher lives just outside of Boston and has held a research position with MIT for over 5 years. He is an Alumni of the University of Massachussets where he received his degree in physics. For Nick, creativity and innovation has always been a major passion, whether it was solving math problems in a new way, building model rockets from scratch, going to art school or when he was young taking apart his parents' electronics to see how they worked. In 2011 Nick started The Christopher Haven Foundation to help encourage the innovators, the free thinkers and the dreamers; creativity is one of the most powerful tools in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Working with The Christopher Haven Foundation he hopes to help students develop more interest in the classroom, focus less on memorizing a text book and more on finding interest and understanding in a given subject. He hopes these young creative minds will help to inspire and educate the next generation of students.</p>

  <h4>Louise Casey</h4>
  <p>Louise Casey is an Alumni of The University of Massachusetts at Lowell. She graduated in December 2005 with a Degree in Psychology, Liberal Arts Option. She went on to pursue a graduate certificate in Homeland Security and graduated in 2006. Louise is married and currently stays at home with her three children. Her husband Shaun has been in the military for over 9 years.  Louise tries to inspire her children to use their minds to solve problems. Her son, who is 5, already performs "experiments" to learn how things work, why they work that way, and if it doesnâ€™t work, why. Learning is fun and if you can make learning fun you will have a child who will always have a passion to learn, to not just accept what a book, or society says, but to test how and why something works the way it does. Louise plans on pursuing her Masters in Psychology.  Louise was inspired by Christopher Haven after taking his Physics class in High School. He showed a new way of learning through creativity, and through innovations, and made a subject as hard as Physics fun, exciting, and interesting.</p>

  <h4>Elizabeth Haven</h4>
  <p>My name is Elizabeth Haven and I am the oldest daughter of Chris Haven. I am currently living in Dover NH, attending graduate school at the University of the New Hampshire (UNH) part time and working as the Operations Manager of the Digital Living Consortium at the UNH InterOperability Labortatory. I have a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics with a minor in Women's Studies from UNH. I enjoy spending most of my free time outside and have a passion for the environment. I love camping, hiking, and am learning how to snowboard. If I am not outside, I am inside cooking, out tasting different foods, reading, and playing games with my family and friends.</p>

<p>Some of the clearest memories I have of my father are in his classroom. Although I was very young, I distinctly remember getting the feeling he truly loved what he was doing and this was where he belonged. I will never forget the overwhelming amount of people that respected and loved my father. Students, colleagues, friends and family of my fathers, all have different stories of how he dramatically changed their life through teaching, friendship, his passion, etc. For this reason and so many more, my father is my hero. I don't believe it is possible for me to have the impact on people the way my father did, but I will continue to try and live up to the person he was and make him proud. I hope with my help, the Chris Haven Foundation will help shape young learners into creative, independent thinkers, and passionate individuals. It is my vision that this will have a similar impact, my father had on his students, and me.</p>
