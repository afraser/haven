  <h4>Nick Mosher</h4>
  <p>Nick Mosher lives just outside of Boston and has held a research position with MIT for over 5 years. He is an Alumni of the University of Massachussets where he got his degree in physics. For Nick Creativity and Innovation has always been a major passion, whether it was solving math problems in a new way, building model rockets from scratch, going to art school or when he was young taking apart his parent's electronics to see how they worked. In 2011 Nick Mosher started The Christopher Haven Foundation to help encourage the innovators, the free thinkers and the dreamers; creativity is one of the most powerful tools in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Working with The Christopher Haven Foundation he hopes to help students develop more interest in the classroom, focus less on memorizing a text book and more on finding interest and understanding on the subject being taught. He hopes years down the road these young creative minds will help to inspire the next generation of students.</p>

  <h4>Louise Casey</h4>
  <p>Louise Casey is an Alumni of The University of Massachusetts at Lowell. She graduated in December 2005 with a Degree in Psychology, Liberal Arts Option. She went on to pursue a graduate certificate in Homeland Security and graduated in 2006. Louise is married and currently stays at home with her three children. Her husband Shaun has been in the military for over 9 years.  Louise tries to inspire her children to use their minds to solve problems. Her son, who is 5, already performs “experiments” to learn how things work, why they work that way, and if it doesn’t work, why. Learning is fun and if you can make learning fun you will have a child who will always have a passion to learn, to not just accept what a book, or society says, but to test how and why something works the way it does. Louise plans on pursuing her Masters in Psychology.  Louise was inspired by Christopher Haven after taking his Physics class in High School. He showed a new way of learning through creativity, and through innovations, and made a subject as hard as Physics fun, exciting, and interesting.</p>
