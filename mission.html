<h3>Bridging the Creative Gap</h3>

<p>At The Chris Haven Foundation we are dedicated to bringing back more of the innovators, the free-thinkers, and the dreamers in the fields of Science and Engineering. If we look at contributions over time from Science and Engineering we see new ideas, new designs, new systems., new etc. In other words Science and Engineering have made major changes through novelty. Current students don’t realize this since grading and ranking has become the major priority through either standardized testing or piling up achievements that look good. We hope to help encourage a creative mindset in students through scholarships, after school activities, educational funding and research grants. Helping these students along the way with the hopes that after graduating college and getting a great job they will in turn help and inspire the next generation of students.</p>

 <p>This organization is named after a physics teacher most of the Board Members (myself included) had during our years in High School, Christopher Haven. Mr. Haven was an extraordinary teacher who had a big impact on all our lives. He made physics fun or “Phun” as he called it, he would hold Egg Launch Competitions, Toothpick Bridge Competitions, he had a bed of nails he would lay down on to show kids how pressure worked; he should his students in rather fun and creative ways the physics of the world around us. Mr. Haven was incredible until the end when he lost a battle with cancer that he had been fighting for years.</p>

 <p>Change is the only true constant, in the time that has gone by since his passing we have skewed from creativity and innovation to a nation of test takers and after students score high on those tests they forget almost all of it because they haven't learned how to apply it to the real world and haven't established any interest in it. We hope to give guidance and incentive toward the outside the box problem solving mentality that is becoming more and more needed in Science and Engineering for expansion that will lead to the next big idea.</p>

 <p>Through the support individuals like yourself we hope to make this possible. Whether it be volunteering, a donation, suggestions or just tuning in every now and then to see what’s going you can help encourage this creative mindset in students today. The young minds out there are perhaps are most important resource, we here at the Christopher Haven Foundation hope to help these minds form a nice solid foundation off of which they will construct amazing things.</p>
